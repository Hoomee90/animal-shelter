  <h3>Adopt an "Animal" from the world's finest no kill, dematerialize, unsubstantiate or narratively derealize shelter</h3></div>
  <p class="desc">Inconsistently located at the intersection of Paper Street and Lampshading Boulevard, our "Animal" Shelter has been in operation for over five minutes. We've never turned down any creature, beast, abberation, or metanarrative entity and as such  have the largest collection of any shelter. This may or may not also have something to do with the way time works within our premises, or more accurately, doesn't.</p>
  <h3>Consider adopting one of our new arrivals</h3>
