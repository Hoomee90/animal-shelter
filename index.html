  <h1 class=>Cal's <span class="not-animal">"Animal"</span> Shelter</h1>
  <h3>Adopt an "Animal" from the world's finest no kill, dematerialize, unsubstantiate or narratively derealize shelter</h3></div>
  <p class="company-info">Inconsistently located at the intersection of Paper Street and Lampshading Boulevard, our "Animal" Shelter has been in operation for over five minutes. We've never turned down any creature, beast, abberation, or metanarrative entity and as such  have the largest collection of any shelter. This may or may not also have something to do with the way time works within our premises, or more accurately, doesn't.</p>
  <h3>Consider adopting one of our new arrivals:</h3>

    <div class="one-file"><p>Luna</p>
      <img><ul>
      <p class="desc">Luna is a curious and playful Golden Retriever. She's just under two years old and ready for a good home!</p>
      <li>Gets along with other dogs, children, cats and the unspeakable things that lurk in the shadows</li>
      <li>Brought to Cal's after her pervious owner disapeared under mysterious circumstances. He didn't walk her enough anyways</li>
      <li>Voted "Least likely to cheat at poker" by staff</li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="two-file"><p>Xybryxis The Destroyer</p>
      <img><ul>
      <p class="desc">Xybryxsis - also known as Brixie for short - is a Class Ïˆ World Ender, picked up when they got lost in an Ikea. Though prickly at first, if you can win their trust, you might just have yourself a lifelong companion. And believe us, your life will be very, very long.</p>
      <li>Loves hugs, but only from people who can recite the alphabet backwards and <em>can't</em> do long division in their head</li>
      <li>Don't worry! Brixie has never seriously injured anybody. Those people are no longer extant enough to be considered much of anything at all</li>
      <li>They've been known to offer small tokens to visitors. They are nothing more than objects to commemorate your time here. Probably.</li>
